      Dearest Nada,<br><br>

      Nine months ago, you walked into my life, and I had no idea that in such a short time,
      my entire world would change for the better. Today, as we celebrate two months of being
      engaged, I find myself looking back at how quickly "me" became "us."<br><br>

      They say when you know, you know, and with you, I knew instantly. These past two months
      as your fiancé have been the happiest of my life. Walking through the world knowing that
      I get to spend the rest of my days with you by my side gives me a sense of peace and purpose
      I never knew existed.<br><br>

      You are so much more to me than just my future wife. You are my home, my greatest comfort,
      and the person who makes every day feel like a celebration. Your laugh is my favorite sound,
      and your heart is the most beautiful thing I have ever known.<br><br>

      Thank you for saying "yes" to me. Thank you for these six incredible months of getting to
      know your soul, and for the two months of planning a future that I know will be more
      beautiful than I ever dreamed.<br><br>

      I love you more than words can capture, and I can’t wait to call you my wife.<br><br>

      <strong>Happy Anniversary, my beautiful Nada ♥️♥️♥️.</strong><br><br>

      Yours forever,<br>
      <strong>Ali</strong>
